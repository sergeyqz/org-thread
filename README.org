* org-thread

Reading various stuff like HN comment threads in org-mode.

Call ~org-thread~ to open ~*org-thread*~ buffer. Add a new heading of the next form

#+begin_src org-mode
,* @hn emacs
#+end_src

where ~@hn~ is a site you want to search, following is the query. Press ~C-c s~ to search:

#+begin_src org-mode
,* @hn emacs
,** Buttery Smooth Emacs...
,** New GNU Emacs website...
#+end_src

Move cursor to a result and press ~C-c c~ to load its comments under the heading.

~C-c C-o~ while on a result opens result URL in browser (~org-open-at-point~ function from ~org-mode~).

** Supported search engines
  - DuckDuckGo (~ddg~)
  - Hacker News (~hn~)

** Issues
For some reason I get opened property drawers sometimes. ~C-u C-u TAB~ (~org-set-startup-visibility~) helped me (https://orgmode.org/manual/Initial-visibility.html).
